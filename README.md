## SMS Thru GSM Modem


</div>

### Description

I wrote this program for testing my Wavecom Modem which was used to collect data for Power Meters. As doing this was fun, I thought that other having similar modems can use this code for sending and receiving SMS on there computers. I have not commented the code as this was just for fun. This code can be modified to do some remote controlling work as i have tried to show in the example i.e. when u send an sms containg notepad the notepad.exe is run after the message is decoded. This was just for fun. If any help or details needed regarding the program u may as freely.
 
### More Info
 
U need to have Wavecom GSM Modem to use this code.
